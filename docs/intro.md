# Introduction

This is a demo site created for the aelfinity workshop.

# Objective

The objective of this workshop is to get familiar with how to:

- [Create a new token](/docs/create-token) on AElf Chain using `aelf-command`.
- Use `@portkey/detect-provider` to [authenticate](/docs/sign-in) with Portkey Wallet, call the [getBalance](/docs/get-balance) method, and [get NFT](/docs/get-nft).
- [Deploy a sample contract](/docs/smart-contract) to AElf node.
- Interact with the deployed smart contract on the [frontend](/docs/smart-contract-frontend).
