:::info
Since aelf has a singleton `MultiToken` system contract serving all the tokens, tokens are identified by their unique symbols. This is unlike on Ethereum or other EVM based blockchains where
a fresh ERC20 or ERC721 contract has to be deployed if you want to issue your own tokens. To guard the rarity of symbols and avoid abuse, a marketplace called the `Token Symbol Market` was introduced to provide a mechanism
for developer who wish to issue their own tokens to grab the symbols they desire.
