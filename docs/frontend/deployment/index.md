You may use any web service that supports static site deployments.

To keep things simple, we can try Surge.sh.

```bash
cd frontend
npm install --save-dev surge
npm run build
npx surge
```

At the prompt, enter your email address and set a new password to set up a new surge account.

When prompted, add the `/dist` to the end of project:

```bash
        project: .../aelf-nus-workshop-2024/frontend/dist
         domain: <subdomain autogenerated>.surge.sh
```

Visit the auto-generated url to view your frontend site.
