# Start a .NET project for smart contract

For this section, we will create a smart contract that generates random numbers.

## 1. Install the template
Like other types of projects on .NET, a smart contract project can be created from a template. The following command can be used to install the template to your machine.

```bash
dotnet new install AElf.ContractTemplates
```

## 2. Create the project using the template

```bash
mkdir workshop
cd workshop
dotnet new aelf -n HelloWorld
```

Open the `workshop` folder in your IDE. You will see the project folder containing the `src` and `test` code.

After this you can modify the state, method logics and interfaces according to your business logics.
