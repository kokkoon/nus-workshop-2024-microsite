# Smart contract

## Introduction

The core of blockchain platforms can be viewed as a distributed multi-tenant database that stores the status of all the smart contracts deployed on it. Once deployed, each smart contract will have its unique address. The address will be used to query the execution status of the contract and can work as an identifier for status queries and updates. The contract code defines the details of these and updates, to be specific, how to check whether an account has permission to operate them and how the operation is completed.
