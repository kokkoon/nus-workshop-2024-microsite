# Grab SEED from Token Symbol Market

:::info
The [Token Symbol Market (TESTNET)](https://test.eforest.finance/symbolmarket) is an easy-to-use platform for users to create fungible and non-fungible tokens on aelf blockchain.

Unlike on EVM where token creation requires deploying a new ERC20 or ERC721 contract, AElf has a system contract where all common token logics are implemented and tokens are identified uniquely by the symbol.

Token creation on aelf requires the use of a SEED which may be obtained from Token Symbol Market by buying (or bidding for popular symbol names) using ELF.
