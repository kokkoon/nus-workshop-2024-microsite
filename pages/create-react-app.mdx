# Create react app

This workshop uses Create React App as the framework to rapidly prototype a react application. You should be fine using any other framework like NextJS or GatsbyJS (note that there might be additional configuration required).

## Create a new react app

Open Terminal.

Run the following command to create a new react app in a folder `portkey-workshop-contracts-demo`.

```sh copy
npx create-react-app portkey-workshop-contracts-demo
```

Enter the project directory.

```sh copy
cd portkey-workshop-contracts-demo
```

Install `aelf-sdk`.

```sh copy
npm i aelf-sdk
```

Start the development server.

```sh copy
npm start
```
