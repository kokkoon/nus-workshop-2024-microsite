# Create a Token on AElf Chain

## Preparation

- Install node.
  - Follow this doc https://nodejs.org/en/download to install node and npm.
  - Type ```node -v``` and ```npm -v```, if return the versions, the installation is successful.

- Run the following command to install aelf-command tool.

```sh copy
npm i aelf-command -g
```

- Run the following command to create a new aelf account. If you already have account, you can continue use your account.

```sh copy
aelf-command create
```

## Creation

- Firstly, before creating the token/NFT, we need to get the seed NFT......

- Run the following commands to create a new token. The symbol of the created token must be consistent with the symbol applied for in the seed NFT.

```sh copy
aelf-command send AElf.ContractNames.Token -e https://aelf-test-node.aelf.io
```

Key in the password. Choose the Create method and key in parameters as follows:

```sh copy
Enter the params one by one, type `Enter` to skip optional param:
? Enter the required param <symbol>: WKSPTKAAA
? Enter the required param <tokenName>: WKSPTKAAA Token
? Enter the required param <totalSupply>: 100000000000
? Enter the required param <decimals>: 8
? Enter the required param <issuer>: W1ptWN5n5mfdVvh3khTRm9KMJCAUdge9txNyVtyvZaYRYcqc1
? Enter the required param <isBurnable>: false
? Enter the required param <lockWhiteList>: 
? Enter the required param <issueChainId>: 9992731
? Enter the required param <externalInfo.value>: 
? Enter the required param <owner>: W1ptWN5n5mfdVvh3khTRm9KMJCAUdge9txNyVtyvZaYRYcqc1
```

- After creating the token, it is only creating the token's information. We still need to issue it before we can use the token. Run the following commands.

```sh copy
aelf-command send AElf.ContractNames.Token -e https://aelf-test-node.aelf.io
```

Key in the password. Choose the Issue method and key in parameters as follows:

```sh copy
Enter the params one by one, type `Enter` to skip optional param:
? Enter the required param <symbol>: WKSPTKAAA
? Enter the required param <amount>: 1000000
? Enter the required param <memo>: transfer
? Enter the required param <to>: {address}
```

## Usage

Run the following commands to transfer token from issuer to others.

```sh copy
aelf-command send AElf.ContractNames.Token -e https://aelf-test-node.aelf.io
```

Key in the password. Choose the Transfer method and key in parameters as follows:

```sh copy
Enter the params one by one, type `Enter` to skip optional param:
? Enter the required param <to>: {to_address}
? Enter the required param <symbol>: WKSPTKAAA
? Enter the required param <amount>: 10000
? Enter the required param <memo>: transfer
```
